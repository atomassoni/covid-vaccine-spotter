      <strong>04/06/2021:</strong> New pharmacies! ðŸ˜ƒ
      <strong>Health Mart</strong> locations (which includes 4,900+ independent
      pharmacies) and <strong>Price Chopper / Market 32</strong> locations are
      all now being scanned for open appointments. This adds a lot of new stores
      across the country. I hope this helps! Any feedback is welcome:

      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
